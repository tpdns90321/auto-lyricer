      "taskTitle": "Implement Core API Endpoints",
      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Core API Endpoints' task into 5 subtasks, focusing on: 1) Implementing the remaining API endpoints for transcription and subtitles, 2) Adding comprehensive request validation with Pydantic, 3) Implementing pagination and filtering capabilities, 4) Adding proper error handling and status codes, and 5) Documenting the API with OpenAPI/Swagger.",
      "reasoning": "This task already has 5 well-defined subtasks but could benefit from additional organization. The complexity is high (7/10) due to the need to implement multiple API endpoints with validation, error handling, pagination, and documentation. The task requires understanding of FastAPI, Pydantic, and RESTful API design principles."

      "taskTitle": "Implement YouTube Integration Service",
      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement YouTube Integration Service' task into 4 subtasks: 1) Implement video metadata retrieval functionality using yt-dlp, 2) Develop audio extraction capabilities with format conversion, 3) Create a caching mechanism for extracted data, and 4) Implement error handling and rate limit management.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves integrating with external services (YouTube) and handling media processing. The complexity score of 6 reflects the challenges of working with the yt-dlp library, implementing proper caching, and handling YouTube's rate limits and errors. Breaking it into 4 subtasks allows for focused implementation of each component."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Transcription Service with Whisper' task into 5 subtasks: 1) Set up Whisper model integration and basic transcription functionality, 2) Implement audio preprocessing for optimal transcription quality, 3) Develop timestamp extraction and formatting for transcribed segments, 4) Create background processing for transcription tasks, and 5) Implement multi-language support and result caching.",
      "reasoning": "This task has high complexity (8/10) as it involves machine learning model integration, audio processing, and handling potentially resource-intensive operations. The task requires understanding of Whisper's API, audio preprocessing techniques, and efficient background processing. Five subtasks would provide a good balance of focus areas."

      "taskTitle": "Implement Lyrics Alignment Service",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Lyrics Alignment Service' task into 5 subtasks: 1) Design and implement the LLM prompt engineering for lyrics alignment, 2) Develop the core alignment algorithm to match lyrics with timestamps, 3) Create validation and correction mechanisms for alignment results, 4) Implement SRT file generation from aligned lyrics, and 5) Build fallback mechanisms for handling alignment failures.",
      "reasoning": "This task has very high complexity (9/10) as it involves sophisticated LLM prompt engineering, complex alignment algorithms, and validation logic. The task requires deep understanding of both LLM capabilities and the structure of lyrics and transcriptions. Five subtasks would help manage this complexity by separating prompt design, core algorithm, validation, output generation, and error handling."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Implement Translation Service' task into 4 subtasks: 1) Develop the core translation functionality using LLM or translation APIs, 2) Implement timing preservation mechanisms for translated content, 3) Create caching and optimization for translated content, and 4) Build SRT file generation for translated subtitles.",
      "reasoning": "This task has significant complexity (7/10) due to the challenges of preserving timing information during translation and ensuring high-quality translations of potentially idiomatic content. Four subtasks would allow focus on the core translation functionality, timing preservation, optimization/caching, and output generation."

      "complexityScore": 6,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the 'Develop Frontend Video Player Component' task into 4 subtasks: 1) Set up the basic video.js player with YouTube integration, 2) Implement subtitle display and WebVTT support, 3) Create controls for subtitle toggling and language selection, and 4) Implement responsive design and custom styling for the player.",
      "reasoning": "This task has moderate complexity (6/10) as it involves integrating video.js with YouTube and implementing subtitle functionality. The frontend component requires knowledge of React, video.js, and WebVTT. Four subtasks would provide a logical progression from basic player setup to advanced subtitle features and styling."

      "reasoning": "This task has significant complexity (7/10) as it involves creating multiple form components, implementing validation, managing state, and ensuring responsive design. The UI needs to handle various user interactions and display states. Five subtasks would help organize the work into logical components of the interface."

      "reasoning": "This task has significant complexity (7/10) as it involves creating a comprehensive API client layer that connects the frontend to all backend services. It requires handling asynchronous operations, WebSocket connections, and error states. Four subtasks would provide a logical separation of concerns for different API domains and shared functionality."
